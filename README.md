# HR-Attrition-Analysis
I have completed this project under the guidence of MeriSkill as data analyst intern. 





STEPS FOLLOWED:

✅ 𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐀 𝐈𝐌𝐏𝐎𝐑𝐓:
First I Gathered data from MeriSkill and imported it into Power BI for data transformation

✅ 𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐀 𝐓𝐑𝐀𝐍𝐒𝐅𝐎𝐑𝐌𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍:
Used Power Query to clean the data, removed nulls and duplicates, and fine-tuned data types.

✅ 𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐀 𝐋𝐎𝐀𝐃𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐌𝐎𝐃𝐄𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐆:
Imported the transformed data into Power View for analysis. After completing the necessary cleaning, and transformation, I create the necessary relationships between the tables. (I created a calendar table separately for my convenience and connected the two tables based on a column key)

✅ 𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐀 𝐈𝐌𝐏𝐋𝐄𝐍𝐓𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍:
I used different DAX functions to create calculated measures and columns, refining the data for deeper insights.

✅ 𝐑𝐄𝐏𝐎𝐑𝐓 𝐂𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍:
